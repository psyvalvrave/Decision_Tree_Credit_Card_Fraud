# Decision_Tree_Credit_Card_Fraud

## Overview
This project is the final project for the Foundations of Artificial Intelligence course. It focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using a decision tree approach. The model analyzes patterns in transaction data to identify potential frauds, thereby minimizing the risks associated with credit card transactions. This implementation is conceptual and does not use Python.

## Course Information
This project serves as a capstone for understanding and applying artificial intelligence techniques in real-world scenarios. It encapsulates the principles learned throughout the course and demonstrates the practical application of decision trees in fraud detection.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kelvinkelue/credit-card-fraud-prediction/data?select=fraud+test.csv). It includes features indicative of potentially fraudulent transactions.

## Decision Tree Technique
The decision tree is used for classifying transactions into fraudulent or non-fraudulent categories based on learned data patterns. It is favored for its interpretability and effectiveness in classification tasks.

## How It Works
1. **Data Preparation:** The dataset is preprocessed to suit decision tree modeling. This includes managing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
2. **Building the Tree:** The tree is built by choosing splits that maximize purity gains. This recursive partitioning continues until a specified depth or minimum node size is achieved.
3. **Prediction:** Transactions are classified as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on the criteria defined in the decision tree.

## Usage
This model serves as an educational tool for students, data analysts, and fraud investigators interested in exploring decision tree applications in fraud detection without employing programming.

## Results
The decision tree model successfully identified fraudulent transactions, demonstrating the effectiveness of AI techniques learned in the course. Performance metrics will provide further insight into its accuracy and precision.
