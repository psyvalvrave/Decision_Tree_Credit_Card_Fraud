# Decision_Tree_Credit_Card_Fraud
## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using a decision tree approach. By analyzing patterns in transaction data, the model identifies potential frauds, helping in minimizing the risks associated with credit card transactions. This implementation does not use Python but relies on a conceptual understanding of decision trees in fraud detection.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kelvinkelue/credit-card-fraud-prediction/data?select=fraud+test.csv). It includes various features related to credit card transactions that are indicative of potential fraud.

## Decision Tree Technique
The decision tree model is a popular choice for classification tasks such as fraud detection due to its interpretability and effectiveness. In this project, the decision tree was used to classify transactions into fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on patterns learned from the training data.

## How It Works
The model is built on the principles of decision trees where decisions are made at every node based on certain criteria. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the process:

1. **Data Preparation:** The data is preprocessed to fit the requirements of a decision tree algorithm. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data if necessary.
2. **Building the Tree:** The decision tree is constructed by splitting the dataset into subsets based on the attribute that results in the highest purity gain. This process continues recursively until a stopping criterion is met.
3. **Prediction:** For each new transaction, the decision tree makes predictions based on the rules learned during training, determining whether the transaction is likely to be fraudulent.

## Usage
This project can be used by data analysts and fraud investigators looking to understand the application of decision trees in fraud detection without directly using Python or any specific programming language.

## Results
The decision tree model was able to successfully identify fraudulent transactions with a high degree of accuracy. Specific performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) can be included based on the results obtained during testing.
